## Introduction

[**AnimeThemes**](https://animethemes.moe/) is a simple and consistent repository of anime opening and ending themes. We provide direct links to high quality WebMs of your favorite OPs and EDs for your listening and discussion needs.

This is the organization for the AnimeThemes open-source project. Here you will find the repositories for the software that comprise the AnimeThemes.moe webservice as well as packages and other tooling we use to run the project.

AnimeThemes is a hobbyist project run by a group of volunteers. We are always in need of more help. If you are interested in collaborating with us, feel free to reach out here or through any of our socials.

## Currently Working On

We are currently working on adding support for external profiles. Users will be able to sync their list with a tracker site like MAL or AniList.

Changes will be initially deployed to our [**beta environment**](https://beta.animethemes.moe/wiki) for testing and user acceptance. If you are interested in early access, please consider supporting us on [**Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/AnimeThemes) or [**Ko-fi**](https://ko-fi.com/animethemes).
